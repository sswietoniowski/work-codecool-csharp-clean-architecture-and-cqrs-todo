# Todo

Sample project showing how to configure a solution using Clean Architecture approach and CQRS + MediatR.

BTW ... I'm fully aware that such architectural choices makes little sense for a todo application ;-),
but at the same time, it is difficuilt to explain complex concepts starting with complex example :P.
